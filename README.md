## **Description üìù**
**This mod is based on "Mistborn" Brandon Sanderson books saga**, therefore we recommend having read some books of the saga before playing with the mod. Obviously we recommend all the author's works.

Metallics Arts is a mod for Minecraft 1.16.5, designed to work with the Forge API.

This mod is a fork of Lego's Allomancy mod, so we recommend you check out his work, as his mod has a lot to offer and without a doubt: It's at least twice as cool as ours!

Our mod adds all three metal arts (Allomancy, Feruchemy and Hemalurgy) to Minecraft.

We add new blocks, recipes, items and a new alloy furnace! All this to be able to access the incredible powers of the metallics arts.

## **About us üôã**
We are a small team of 3 people: 2 developers and 1 designer. We did all the code and all the textures. We also got help from the community of "El Club De Las Tormentas". We recommend his YT and Twitch channel!

We are RuDaHee, TobibusFate and Farck! You can get our contact in final notes section.

We made the mod for the community's mistborn-oriented server (of which we are moderators haha), and also, contribute our work to anyone who wants to enjoy the mod.

So we really hope you enjoy it!
